## Overview

The AFL Data Analysis project provides a comprehensive platform for examining and deriving insights from AFL match and player data. Whether you're a sports enthusiast, a tipper, a data scientist, or a student, this repository offers valuable resources for diving into the world of Australian Rules Football. 

The repository currently stores match scores data from 1897 to 2025, in depth personal and game statistics for every player who have ever played in the VFL/AFL and historical odds data from 2009 to 2024. All the data is  conveniently stored in CSV format for seamless access and analysis.

Download the repository and explore the **/data/** directory for the complete dataset. 

Contributions are encouraged; don't hesitate to submit a pull request or contact me with the details on my GitHub profile.

## Features

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akareen/AFL-Data-Analysis.git
   cd AFL-Data-Analysis
   ```

2. (Skip if you just want the data) Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

I regularly update the CSV data files in the **/data** directory with the latest AFL match and player data. But you can also do your own data scraping using the provided scripts in the "scripts" directory. Scripts, using the Beautiful Soup library, are available for web scraping.


## Data Guide

### Match Data -  Explanation

The repository contains the information for all matches from 1897-2023.

![Match Data Example](/assets/matchdata_example.png)

The above includes part of the data the columns are too numerous to show completely. An example of a selection of the match data can be seen here: [matches_2023.csv](data/matches/matches_2023.csv)

**The columns for each match are as follows:**   
Year, Round, Venue, Date,  
Home Team, Away Team,   
Home Teams Goals by Quarter, Home Teams Behinds by Quarter,  
Away Teams Goals by Quarter, Away Teams Behinds by Quarter,  
Home Total Goals, Home Total Behinds,  
Away Total Goals, Away Total Behinds,  
Winning Team, Margin  

All the columns are in **snake case** and there is a column for each quarter such as **home_q1_g** for Home Team Quarter 1 goals and **away_q1_b** for Away team Quarter 1 Behinds.

### Player Data - Explanation

#### Player Performance Data

![Player Performance Data Example](/assets/playerstats_example.png)

An example of the player performance data can be seen here: [BONTEMPELLI_MARCUS_24-11-1995_STATS.csv](data/players/bontempelli_marcus_24111995_performance_details.csv)

**The columns for each player are as follows:**  

Team, Year, Games Played, Opponent, Round, Result,   
Jersey Num, Kicks, Marks, Handballs, Disposals, Goals, Behinds, Hit Outs,   
Tackles, Rebound 50s, Inside 50s, Clearances, Clangers, Free Kicks For, Free Kicks Against,   
Brownlow Votes, Contested Possessions, Uncontested Possessions, Contested Marks, Marks Inside 50,   
One Percenters %, Bounces, Goal Assist, % Percentage of Game Played

Inside the data all the columns are in **snake case**. The file format is *{last_name}_{first_name}_{born_date}_performance.csv*.


#### Player Personal Data

**The columns for each player are as follows:**
First Name, Last Name, Born Date, Debut Date, Height, Weight

Inside the data all the columns are in **snake case** and the players born date along with first and last name are used to create a unique identifier for each player. The file format is The file format is *{last_name}_{first_name}_{born_date}_personal.csv*.


## Data Sources

This project uses publicly available AFL data sources, including match scores, player statistics, and historical odds data. The data sources are as follows:

- Match and Player Data: [AFL Tables](https://afltables.com/afl/afl_index.html)
- Historical Odds Data: [AusSportsBetting](https://www.aussportsbetting.com/data/historical-afl-results-and-odds-data/)


## Scraping Examples
While data is readily available in the repository, here's how you can use scraping if needed.

- To scrape match scores data from 1897 to 2024 and store it in the "data/matches" directory, and player data into the "data/players" directory:

  ```bash
  python main.py --start_year 1897 --end_year 2024 --scrape_matches --scrape_players --folder_path "data/"
  ```

This command will scrape match data and player data for the years 1897 to 2024, saving it in the `data/matches` and `data/players` directories. You can modify the `start_year`, `end_year`, and folder path to suit your needs.

If you only want to scrape match data (without player data), use:

```bash
python main.py --start_year 1897 --end_year 2024 --scrape_matches --folder_path "data/"
```

Similarly, to scrape only player data, run:

```bash
python main.py --start_year 1897 --end_year 2024 --scrape_players --folder_path "data/"
```

This used to be more granular, but the data is now fully available in the repository. I'll be making a small update soon to bring back the ability to only scrape most recent data without rescraping existing data.
