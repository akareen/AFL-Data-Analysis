## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akareen/AFL-Data-Analysis.git
   cd AFL-Data-Analysis
   ```

2. (Skip if you just want the data) Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

I regularly update the CSV data files in the **/match_and_player_data** directory with the latest AFL match and player data. But you can also do your own data scraping using the provided scripts in the "scripts" directory. Scripts, using the Beautiful Soup library, are available for web scraping.

To start analyzing AFL data, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks in the "notebooks" directory. These notebooks cover a wide range of analyses and visualizations related to AFL match and player data.

### Command Line Options

- `<data_storage_directory>`: Specify the directory where the data will be stored.
- `<option>`: Choose one of the following options:
  - `matches <start year> <end year>`: Collect match scores data within the specified year range.
  - `match_details <start year> <end year>`: Collect match scores data as well as player stats within those matches for the specified year range.
  - `all_players`: Collect data for all players in the VFL/AFL.

Please note that the available data ranges from 1897 to the current year.

## Scraping Examples
While data is readily available in the repository, here's how you can use scraping if needed.

- To scrape match scores data from 1897 to 2023 and store it in the "data/match_scores" directory:

  ```bash
  python scrape.py data/match_scores matches 1897 2023
  ```

- To collect data for all players and store it in the "data/all_players" directory:

  ```bash
  python scrape.py data/all_players all_players
  ```



## Data Guide

### Match Data Explanation

The repository contains the information for all matches from 1897-2023.

**The columns for each match are as follows:**   
Year, Round, Venue, Date, Attendance,  
Home Team, Away Team,   
Home Teams Goals by Quarter, Home Teams Behinds by Quarter,  
Away Teams Goals by Quarter, Away Teams Behinds by Quarter,  
Home Total Goals, Home Total Behinds,  
Away Total Goals, Away Total Behinds,  
Winning Team, Margin  

All the columns are in **snake case** and there is a column for each quarter such as **home_q1_g** for Home Team Quarter 1 goals and **away_q1_b** for Away team Quarter 1 Behinds.

The **match_and_player_data/match_scores** directory contains the match scores data in CSV format for each year. The file format is **{YEAR}_MATCH_RESULTS.csv**.  

The **match_and_player_data/match_details** directory contains the match scores data as well as player statistics for each match in CSV format. The file format is **{YEAR}\_{HOME_TEAM}\_{AWAY_TEAM}\_GAMESTATS.csv** and **{YEAR}\_{HOME_TEAM}\_{AWAY_TEAM}\_TEAMSTATS\_{TEAM}.csv**.

An example of the match data can be seen here: [2023_MATCH_RESULTS.csv](match_and_player_data/match_scores/2023_MATCH_RESULTS.csv)

### Team Data Explanation

The team data is stored by year in the **match_and_player_data/player_data_by_year** directory.  
The information ranges from 1951 to today. It contains all of the player personal data as well as an additional two columns for each player that have the file path to the players personal data and the players performance data. This prevents duplication whilst also allowing for easy access to the data.
